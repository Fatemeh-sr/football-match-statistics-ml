Linear Regression and Cross-Validation on Football Match Statistics

This project uses linear regression models to predict the match outcome (win or loss)
of the home team based on football match statistics. The model performance is
evaluated with and without cross-validation to analyze generalization behavior.

-Objective
Predict home team win or loss using match statistics and compare results with and
without cross-validation.
